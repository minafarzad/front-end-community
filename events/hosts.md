# WWCDC Front End Lab Hosts

Su Kim schedules the time and location of each event, but each Front End Lab lead should follow up with the hosts a week before and the day of the event. Please see Su if you'd like to schedule an event but do not have a host for the event.

Front End Lab is always from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm every Monday, except holidays.

Due to privacy concerns, contact Su Kim for host contact (e.g. name, cellphone number), building access policy, and refreshments information. Do not publish on Github.
